  "stockItem": "Product Name",
  "quantity": 50,
  "pricePerUnit": 85.0,

## Authentication & Security

### Protected Routes
- Seller dashboard is protected by `ProtectedRoute` component
- Requires user to be logged in with `userType: 'SELLER'`
- Redirects unauthorized users to login page

### User Context
The seller dashboard expects user object with:
```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "farmerId": 1,
  "name": "Seller Name",
  "email": "seller@example.com",
  "userType": "SELLER"
}
```

## API Integration

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to mock data when backend is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages via snackbar notifications
- Loading states during API calls

### Mock Data
For testing without backend, the API includes fallback mock data:
- Sample products with realistic data
- Category dropdown options
- Sample statistics

## Backend Setup

### Database Requirements

- Categories table (`category`)
- Farmers table (`farmer`)
- Orders and order details for statistics

### Key Backend Features
